## Setup Instructions

### 1. Download Images
1. Open `images/image-list.html` in a browser
2. Right-click each image and save with the specified filename
3. Place all images in the `images/` folder

### 2. Deploy to Web Server
Upload all files to your web server maintaining the folder structure:
- Upload `index.html`, `flights.html`, `payment.html` to root
- Upload `style.css` to root
- Upload `images/` folder with all images
- Upload `fonts/` folder if using custom fonts

### 3. Test Locally
You can test locally by opening `index.html` in a web browser. For best results, use a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if installed)
npx serve .

# Then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Browser Compatibility

- **Modern browsers**: Chrome 70+, Firefox 65+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+
- **Mobile browsers**: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet
- **Features used**: CSS Grid, Flexbox, modern JavaScript (ES6+)

## Static Limitations

Since this is a static export, the following features are simulated:
- **User authentication**: Shows modals but doesn't actually authenticate
- **Search functionality**: Shows mock results instead of real search
- **Payment processing**: Simulates payment flow without real transactions
- **Database interactions**: All data is hardcoded in JavaScript
- **Email sending**: Shows success messages but doesn't send emails

## Customization

### Adding More Images
1. Add image files to the `images/` folder
2. Update HTML `src` attributes to reference new images
3. Ensure images are optimized for web (JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics)

### Modifying Content
- **Text content**: Edit directly in HTML files
- **Colors**: Modify CSS custom properties in `style.css`
- **Layout**: Adjust CSS Grid and Flexbox properties
- **Discount codes**: Update the `discountCodes` object in `payment.html`

### Adding New Pages
1. Create new HTML file following the existing structure
2. Copy header and footer from existing pages
3. Add navigation links in the header
4. Include `style.css` for styling

## Performance Optimization

- **Images**: Compress images to reduce file size
- **CSS**: Already minified and optimized
- **JavaScript**: Minimal inline JS for basic interactivity
- **Fonts**: Using system fonts for fast loading

## SEO Considerations

- **Meta tags**: Added appropriate title and meta tags
- **Semantic HTML**: Using proper heading hierarchy and semantic elements
- **Alt text**: All images should have descriptive alt attributes
- **URLs**: Use descriptive filenames for better SEO

## Security Notes

- **No sensitive data**: All data is client-side only
- **Form validation**: Basic client-side validation included
- **HTTPS**: Should be deployed with SSL certificate
- **Content Security Policy**: Can be added via meta tags if needed

## Contact & Support

This static export maintains the visual design and basic functionality of the original Booking.com clone. For advanced features like real payments, user authentication, and database integration, a full-stack application would be required.
